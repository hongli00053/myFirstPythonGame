### Project Description
This is a small Python-based game that I developed as part of my learning process.  It was inspired by a YouTube tutorial (link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6xMBig-pP4) It serves as a hands-on project where I'm practicing my Python programming skills, including game logic, GUI (using Pygame), and working with basic game mechanics. My goal is to continue improving the game and eventually add more advanced features.
Feel free to explore and provide feedback!
